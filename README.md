### Goal
On your Linkedin profile, you cannot move up to the top of the page recommendations you've got from clients or collaborators. I find that pretty annoying, as it's a strong selling argument (testimonials).

Components making this app are meant to be part of my new personal website, demonstrating what I can do as a front-end engineer.

### Initial design
Built from this sketch:

### Note about Linkedin API ðŸ˜ž
The goal of this app is to retrieve received recommendations. Linkedin API provides a [selection of member profile fields](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/fields) available to ["Apply with LinkedIn" developers](https://developer.linkedin.com/partner-programs/apply). I'm currently not part of this program (I applied). [Techcrunch article about this restriction](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/12/linkedin-battens-down-the-hatches-on-api-use-limiting-full-access-to-partners/)

I'm waiting (arf) a response from  the Linkedin Business Dev team:
> Our Business Development team will review all applications and we will endeavor to respond to you within 15 days.
