[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xavcz/linkedin-recommendations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xavcz/linkedin-recommendations)

### Goal
On your Linkedin profile, you cannot move up to the top of the page recommendations you've got from clients or collaborators. I find that pretty annoying, as it's a strong selling argument (testimonials).

This little app is meant to be part of my new personal website, demonstrating what I can do as a front-end engineer.

### What's in there
* It's mainly a React app.
* [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) app as a build tool without configuration 
* Graphql server running on Express thanks to [meteor/apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/meteor-integration) (note: I maintain this package)
* Mocked data for the graphql server
* Server-side rendering (note: static head tags)
* [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), css-in-js ftw
* ESLint + [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
...more to come (storybook, snapshot testing with jest, D3)

### Initial design
Built from this sketch:
