    "text":"Xavier is an excellent MeteorJS developer supported by an entrepreneur mindset. He remains always watchful on the legitimacy of a functional evolution compared to business benefits. This is extremely useful and effective during the design of a MVP, for example.\nHis interpersonal skills, its seriousness and its rigor allowed us to establish very quickly a sustainable relationship of trust.\nI appeal to him on precise and high-level technical points technical which I would not entrust to other freelances."

    "text":"Use Xavier if you want your projects completed in a businesslike fashion. He goes way beyond what you ask for by thinking beyond the code and ensuring your product works together everywhere.\nHe analyzes every requirement to think of ways to make it work better for the user and the owner. When I have asked for a feature, he gives me 3 because he has thought of dependencies and variables I did not.\nHe spends much more time thinking about your product than other developers and puts in the time that is needed to make it all fit together. In addition he is a founding contributor to Nova, Meteor's flagship platform. He knows Meteor over and under and you can't find anybody better."

    "text":"Xavier is an incredibly talented developer, as well as being exceptionally organized, a strong communicator and very forward-thinking. We worked with him on customizations for the Telescope platform and he delivered amazing value given his depth of knowledge of react, redux, ES6/7, graphql, apollo, SASS/CSS and the full stack development and open source paradigm. 10/10 would recommend!"

Having spend some time as a startup coach Xavier also has a great feeling about what you need to do, to get your stuff working in a changing environment. On top of that Xavier is just a very nice person to work with!"
