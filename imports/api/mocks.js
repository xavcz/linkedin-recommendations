      Xavier is an excellent MeteorJS developer supported by an entrepreneur mindset. He remains always watchful on the legitimacy of a functional evolution compared to business benefits. This is extremely useful and effective during the design of a MVP, for example.

      His interpersonal skills, its seriousness and its rigor allowed us to establish very quickly a sustainable relationship of trust.

      I appeal to him on precise and high-level technical points technical which I would not entrust to other freelances.
